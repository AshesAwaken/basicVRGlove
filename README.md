# basicVRGlove

This repo contains arduino firmware and (in the future) OpenVR driver for basic VR gloves using flex sensors

## Parts needed
- Arduino Nano ESP32 (other boards probably work, but this is what I am using)
- Flex sensors (will be model independent)
- Resistors (10kÎ©)

## Current goals
- finger tracking VR (via valve index controller emulation)
- support for aditional buttons and joystick
