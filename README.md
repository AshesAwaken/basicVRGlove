# basicVRGlove

This project uses 5 flex sensors for basic finger tracking (no splay tracking as of right now)

## Parts needed
- Arduino Nano ESP32 (other boards probably work, but this is what I am using)
- Flex sensors (will be model independent)
- Resistors (10kÎ©)

# Functionality

## Current goals
- finger tracking VR (via valve index controller emulation)
- support for aditional buttons and joystick
